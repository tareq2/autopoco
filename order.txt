--- When performing initial configuration

1) Find all the types we wish to play with
   - Grab from configuration
   - Grab from base types of any in configuration

2) Apply type conventions
    - Member registration (that is all) (default ignore base types)
    - This should only happen to types that haven't been added manually

3) Add type members from configuration, don't configure them

3) Apply member conventions - apply scores
     - Type + Name > Name > Type

4) Apply configuration for specific types (ignore hiearchy)

5) Scan hieararchy and merge base rules into derived types

6) DONE

---  When performing anonymous type registration ---

1) Register type + all base types (keep track of each type registered)
2) Apply type conventions to all those types
3) Apply member conventions + apply scores
4) Scan hierarchy and merge base rules into derived types
5) DONE
